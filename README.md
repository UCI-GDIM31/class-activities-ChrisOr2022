Hello World!

### W2
r, g, and b are all float variables because they are not whole numbers. If they were whole numbers without any decinmals, then they would be able to be integers. However, because they aren't, they are float numbers. The bounce number is an integer because bounces can only be counter in whole numbers, not in decimals. And lastly, when fixing the error in the code for part 4, it told us to be weary and always remember that ";" should always be at the end of every line of code, because without it then visual studio wouldn't run it.
