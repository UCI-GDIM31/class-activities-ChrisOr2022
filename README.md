### W1
Wrote and sent an email to Professor Reid. Had much trouble opening the files on Unity because of OneDrive being synced to it. But evntually was able to open it. 

### W2
r, g, and b are all float variables because they are not whole numbers. If they were whole numbers without any decinmals, then they would be able to be integers. However, because they aren't, they are float numbers. The bounce number is an integer because bounces can only be counter in whole numbers, not in decimals. And lastly, when fixing the error in the code for part 4, it told us to be weary and always remember that ";" should always be at the end of every line of code, because without it then visual studio wouldn't run it. 

### W3
We decided to have a string code as the response for the character to give us a text response. We were also talking about using an int value for detecting what the friendship level between the player and npc would be. I am in group 13, and our prompt is taken from tables 7-13 on Canvas. I was thinking about but wasn't able to get a response whether a true or false statement, or an if statement would be used on order for the response to tie into a specific dialogue depending on if the player's friendship level is high enough, and if it indicates that the player knows the NPC's secret. 

### W4 part 1
Table 13: Line 17 uses a true or false method to check if the player is on the ground. If the player is on the ground then they can't jump to the sky again. Line 28 starts to use an if then statement to check if the player is off of the ground after pressing the spacebar, then it will add a downward force when falling down. Line 32 uses a false component to make sure that once the player is grounded that they will no longer be able to keep jumping. So if the player has already placed spacebar, and the grounded statement is false because they are in the air, they will not be able to repeat the code written within the brackets. 

### W4 part 2
I did not manage to complete the week 4 class activity, but I did manage to finally open the file after going through 3 LA's and after seeking the professor's help. A lot of issues occured with it not popping up on GitHUb, and having to copy it multuple times. There was also a couple of occurences where the textures didn't load and it would only show the unity objects in pink. And lastly, after some help with Brandon, and fixing some more issues with OneDrvie, I finally managed to access the Week 4 Unity files with its proper textures. 

### W5 Activity 1
My question was revolving aroudn 3D values being transformed by adding positive values, and if they could also be transformed by subtracting variables instead. My question was that if there there are any examples where having to subtract or add values is necessary within a game, and if its absolutely necessary. However, after discussing with my group for a bit I found out that these could be used as saving points in both 3D and 2D games, or when a player want's to teleport to a certain spot on the game's map. 

### W5 Ativity 2
We created a rigodbody function for the deer itself, the cat, but not the mushroom. We eventually also added a nav mash function for the movement of the cat so that i t can move in any of the three axis. Lastly we set a red mushroom as the target that the deer will chase that will be planted in a specific spot using the mesh nav function.
